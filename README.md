Hi! ðŸ˜ƒ I'm Antonio, I'm a 23 y.o. Front End Developer from MÃ©xico.

I started my coding adventure when i was 16, as I'm a computer technician, but recently I came back to focus on the web development, specially on the Front End.

I'm looking for my first professional opportunity in this industry, I can successfully complete jobs using HTML5, CSS3, SASS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, React.JS. In adition, I'm learning at the same time Java and it framework, Spring/SpringBoot, with the goal of becoming proficient in both Front/Back End.

Thanks for taking your time to read this, and I hope you find my repos useful or interesting. have a nice day!
